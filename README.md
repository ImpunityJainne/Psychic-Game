# Psychic-Game
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. You get 9 tries. If you guess the letter, a nice message pops up and the game resets. If you run out of guesses, a sympathetic message pops up and the game resets.

## Project Status

Yay! The game works! Now I need to go back and clean up my code to make it DRY. (There's currently a lot of copy-pasta going on.)
